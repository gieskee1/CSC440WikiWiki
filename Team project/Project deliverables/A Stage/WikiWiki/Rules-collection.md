### Rules

1. Rumsfeld law: We didn't know what we didn't know about pydocs and pypy until we learned. 
2. KISS principle: We tried to make the package as simple and easy to follow as possible so that others would be able to use and modify our package.
3. Golden Rule: kept audience in mind when designing pypy package
